==Short Description==

Slock.it is a german company having the vision of creating an all-embracing sharing network to rent or share any asset over the Ethereum Blockchain (main chain). Because assets need to have an internet connection in order to be shared over blockchain-based applications, Slock.it also aims to offer solutions in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT). Their main product will be the Universal Sharing Network (USN), a decentralized and open-source infrastructure where assets can be shared for financial gain.<ref name=„website“/><ref name=„solutions“/> To connect assets to the Ethereum Blockchain, Slock.it is developing the Ethereum Computer (EC). The EC-software will be distributed as a file for several Systems on Chips (SoC). Thereby, the hardware can be integrated into any device that one might want to share.<ref name=„ec“>https://slock.it/ethereum_computer.html, accessed on 02.07.2018.</ref> Additionally, Slock.it started to develop another main product, the so-called IOT Layer. This project aims to offer a comprehensive software framework for the gateway between physical IoT devices and the virtual blockchain. The IOT Layer offers payment channels (on- and off-chain), hub services, a marketplace for assets and access control to the connected IoT devices. Furthermore, the IOT Layer integrates IoT devices into existing IoT clouds and IoT environments. By empowering machines to send and receive transactions, it also enables Machine to Machine and Machine to Human interactions.<ref name=„iotlayer“>https://iot.slock.it/iotlayer.html, accessed on 02.07.2018.</ref> In addition, the „Incubed“-client will be part of the IOT Layer offering the possibility to connect to multiple chains without storing any parts of the blockchain. The proposed solution works in a trustless environment. For this purpose, devices are connected to various nodes that are incentivized to provide correct information only to requests of the IoT device.<ref name=„blog1“>https://blog.slock.it/slock-it-iot-layer-f305601df963, accessed on 02.07.2018.</ref>

==Funding==

2017: Slock.it raised about $2M in a seed funding round.<ref name=„funding“/>

Additional Information: In 2016, Slock.it created a Decetralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) called „The DAO“, a set of smart contracts operating on the Ethereum Classic blockchain. Investors can send coins to the DAO and later vote on how to allocate the collected funds among several project proposals. The idea of Slock.it was to make a proposal of their Universal Sharing Network/Ethereum Computer project to raise funds in this way. In the initial phase of The DAO, an attacker discovered a security vulnerability in the code and managed to withdraw around 3.5M ETH (~$50M). Consequently, the community decided to recover the lost funds with a hard fork of the blockchain that resulted in the independently operating Ethereum Blockchain (where „The DAO“-attack was made undone) and the Ethereum Classic Blockchain (where the code of „The DAO“ can still be found).<ref name=„historydao“>https://blog.slock.it/the-history-of-the-dao-and-lessons-learned-d06740f8cfa5, accessed on 02.07.2018.</ref>
