==Short Description==
Power Ledger is based in Australia and provides a peer-to-peer trading solution for 
the power market. The concept of power ledger is based on the interplay of two tokens 
on two different levels of blockchains. POWR is an ERC20 Token on Ethereum and serves 
as an access permission token. To actually trade energy, the POWR token is escrowed in 
a smart contract and thereby changed in to Sparkz which are stable coins and pegged to the 
smallest unit of the local fiat currency. Sparkz are used on EcoChain, a private Proof 
of Stake blockchain which is the backbone of the Power Ledger ecosystem. It manages the 
meter reading, uses information from oracles and enables the trading of Sparks. Power 
Ledger is developing many applications which could run on EcoChain, whereof peer-to-peer 
energy trading is the most advanced. To facilitate the transition from the traditional 
structure of the power sector, Power Ledger offers existing power utilities to create 
their own trading applications on EcoChain. In this way power utilities can slowly 
adapt to the new technology.
