==Short Description==

Nexo AG is a company located in Zug, Switzerland that offers crypto-backed loans to its customers.<ref name=„website“/> The idea behind the project is to give clients the opportunity to unlock their crypto currency’s value without selling them and thereby forgoing potential price gains. In order to provide this service, Nexo created a wallet where customers can deposit their Bitcoins, Ethers and NEXO tokens (in the future, further altcoins will also be accepted).<ref name=„website“/><ref name=„whitepaper“/> For each loan request, a smart contract is created on the blockchain defining the rules of the agreement. The crypto assets are then stored on the contract address and are managed by the smart contract’s code. As soon as the transaction on the blockchain is confirmed, customers can access immediate loans denominated in fiat currency up to the value of the deposited assets. The Nexo Oracle supplies the smart contract with data such as price changes and interest payments. Thus, a flexible adjustment of loan limits due to altered off-chain circumstances is enabled (e.g. price increases). Once the loan is repaid, crypto assets are being unlocked and clients can fully control their coins or tokens. Special loan conditions such as interest discounts apply to customer using NEXO Tokens as deposits.<ref name=„whitepaper“/> In addition, NEXO Tokens pay out 30% from the company’s profits in the form of dividends.<ref name=„dividends“>https://medium.com/nexo/nexo-to-accept-binance-coin-bnb-as-collateral-for-instant-crypto-backed-loans-74bb2fe1cfba, accessed on 09.07.2018.</ref>
