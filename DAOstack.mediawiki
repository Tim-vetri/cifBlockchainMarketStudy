==Short Description==
DAOstack envolved out of the Backfeed project and classifies itself as a operating system for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. They developed a layer framework called "DAO Stack", that concludes all necessary components to create an own DAO in a "LEGO-like" manner. The primary purpose of the project is to allocate the decision making power for any kind of organization to the collective instead of having a top-down hierarchy. Their stack consists out of four different layers; ARC, Alchemy, Arc.js and the ArcHives <ref>https://medium.com/daostack/an-explanation-of-daostack-in-fairly-simple-terms-d0e034739c5a, access 04/07/18.</ref>
*Arc: This is the core framework that provides complete DAO templates and modules from which people will be able to take ideas and  components to create a DAO that suits their needs. Itâ€™s a library of smart contracts. Each of them represents functional elements that can be mixed, matched, and modified to create the complete governance protocol for any given type of DAO. <br />
*Arc.js: The arc framework is quite complex. Nevertheless Arc.js enables frontend developers the possibility to integrate their third  party dapps without blockchain expertise because it`s a JavaScript gate. <br />
*Alchemy: This is the first app built on the DAOstack and outlines a graphic interface that enables users the interaction with the Arc framework and their DAOs.<br />
*The ArcHives: Is a collection of shared records in the DAOstack ecosystem. Its main function is the networking possibility between the third party dapps to simplify further collaborations. <ref>https://hackernoon.com/daostack-synopsis-for-the-average-consumer-7e51bb27c481, access 04/07/18.</ref> <ref>https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf, access 04/07/18.</ref>

==Funding==
The ICO of DAO Stack took place on the 8th of May. The hard cap of 30m was reached within this day. The ico token price was 1 GEN for $1. Only 40% out of the total 100m token was available for token sale. 40% of the GEN were put into the Genesis DAO and the last 20% were reserved for the DAOstack implementations so far and for the future expenditures. <ref name="ico">
