==Short Description==
Etherisc aims to built a blockchain based platform for decentralized insurance applications. For that matter they focus on parametric insurance. With their first prototype Flight Delay DApp the functionality of decentralized insurance products can easily be explained. As costumer one may have the incentive to insure yourself against flight delays. To satisfy this desire in a decentralized way one has to pay a premium to a suited smart contract on the etherisc platform. That's it for the customer. In the background the same smart contract collects as well premiums from other customers with exactly the same need in purpose of risk allocation. Furthermore it ensures a completely automatic pay out to one of the insuree if the delay scenario occurs to one of them. The pay out is then funded by the collected premiums. To ensure correct payment to such an event the smart contracts receives data from an oracle that observes the flight schedule the whole time. To cover the risk of a so called black swan event in which flight disruption would last for several days investors can buy tokenized risk pools and reinsurance the allocated risk e.g. the flight delay risk pool as in the example. This example shows a way to disintermediate the insurance process. On the one hand there is the possibility to reduce the administrative burdens in the insurance sector and on the other hand there arises perspectives to develop new markets, such as corp insurance especially in developing countries or other suited insurance products. <ref> https://www.cash.ch/news/top-news/insurtech-blockchain-kann-die-versicherungen-bis-zehnmal-guenstiger-machen-1112579, 2018</ref> <ref>https://blog.etherisc.com/introduction-to-risk-pool-tokens-on-the-etherisc-protocol-1744de67a57e, access 05/06/18.</ref>

==Funding==
Etherisc`s ICO or as they prefer to say "Token Generating Event" will take part in summer 2018. Already known is that 1 billion tokens will be supplied to a price of USD 0.1 $. The hard cap is fixed at USD 30 millions. The TGE consists of two phases. Firstly there will be an individual cap for registered participants. Secondly the registered participants can contribute unlimited amounts until the hard cap is reached or the TGE ends. <ref> https://blog.etherisc.com/announcing-the-etherisc-dip-token-generating-event-registration-is-now-open-fcc7ccb895b0, access 05/23/18.</ref>

==Revenue Model==
Software as a Service (SaaS) and License Fee


==Additional Informations==
Etherisc's business activities run under the decentralized insurance foundation.
