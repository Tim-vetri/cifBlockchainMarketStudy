==Short Description==

The goal of MediBloc is to build a platform for decentralized healthcare data management.<ref name=„website“/> Currently, medical information is often not exchangeable between institutions, resulting in multiple data records of different institutions. Furthermore, sensitive medical information is subject to the risk of a single point of failure and potential data abuse. On the MediBloc platform, hashes of medical information about patients are stored on the Qtum blockchain, while the encrypted data itself is both stored off-chain on personal devices and distributed via InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The MediBloc application is using smart contracts based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allowing it to change between blockchains flexibly. Patients can disclose their encrypted medical information to selected agents such as healthcare providers and data researchers which eliminates the need to conduct medical examination (e.g. blood tests to determine blood type) multiple times. Additionally, medical researchers can purchase data from patients. Payments within the MediBloc ecosystem are made using Medi Token (MED) on the Qtum blockchain.<ref name=„whitepaper“/> However, they launched the ERC-20 MEDX Token running on the Ethereum blockchain to reach more potential users. For the future, MediBloc plans to build the platform on their own blockchain. Both tokens can then be converted into the cryptocurrency used for transactions on this newly created blockchain.<ref name=„mainnet“/>
